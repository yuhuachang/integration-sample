# Spring Integration Testing

## About the xml configuration for Spring Integration
I do not like xml config. I try to avoid it. But it seems that Spring Integration is designed originally by using xml config.
It is not easy to find an example not using xml config.
There is IDE support but I do not like install special tools just for this.

## About DSL configuration
I found many example of using java DSL for configuration but I think the design DSL is too crazy that it becomes a new programming language without a clear documentation.
I found myself struggling on try-n-error on this DSL language. There is no IDE support.

## Java configuration
I try to use java configuration. I have to dig the source code and DSL samples to create the java config.
It is working but takes too much time.

## Result
I have spent weeks trying to set one simple flow up.
Then I tried Apache Camel and I can complete the same setup in 10 minutes.
I think Apache Camel is better.
